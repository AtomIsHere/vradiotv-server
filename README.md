# VRadio TV Server
This project serves as a spring based RESTful API service for the VRadio project. This primarily handles management of active stations and user authentication.

## Important note
This project is still in development and nowhere near production ready (It isn't even in a functional state at this point in time), things will break and security features will not be totally up to par.
